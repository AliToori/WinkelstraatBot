Hi Sacha,
I have upgraded the bot as per the discussion we had.

Please put all the credentials in Accounts.csv file.
After that, copy the ItemUrls.cvs file from the old bot's WinkelRes directory and paste it into this new bot WinkelRes directory.

Run the bot by opening the WinkelstraatBot.exe file.

The bot will take you to the login page and there will be a CAPTCHA which
you have to solve and the enter your email and password and click on login button.
Remember that this step is a one time requirement only. And you have to complete this
step within 3 minutes for each browser (We can extend this time if you need it to just let me know then)

That's it.

Note: Do not delete any of the "Cookies" files other wise you will lost your session and
then you have to repeat the step No.3 for re-storing it.

Thank you!
Best regards,
Ali
